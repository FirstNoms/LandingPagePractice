Here We Think in COMPONENTS
React Involves:
-- Events are Handled (i.e events in js like, "onclick" etc)
-- State Change (i.e in js, when an event happens there happens a change. e.g calculator)
-- MarkUp and Logic

React involves we think in COMPONENTS.
- React is a Library/Framework of elements written in Javascript
- components is when you have your HTML and JS in one file(a file)
- components involves the separation of conerns, i.e it should do one thing at a time.
- React uses VIRTUAL DOM(false dom)
- in JavaScript, we represent a key value pair by "object"
- Whenever youre putting in a javascript into an html, start with a curly brace
- Whenever youre putting in a javascript object into an html, use a double curly brace, one holding the key:value object & an outer one.
- COMPONENTS ARE REUSEABLE BLOCKS OF CODES, WRITTEN AS A FUNCTION, RETURNS HTML ELEMENTS USING JSX(JavaScript Extension).
- Props(Property) are the values of the components that differentiates each component from the other.
- when you create a component, you must return something that  references(looks like) the component e.g
function Button(){
    return(<button></button>)
}
